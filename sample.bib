abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) is an upcoming platform where information and communication technology connect multiple embedded devices to the Internet for performing information exchange. Owing to the immense development of this technology, embedded devices are becoming more sophisticated every day and are being deployed in various arenas of life. An important advancement in today's technology is the ability to connect such devices to large resource pools such as cloud. Integration of embedded devices and cloud servers brings wide applicability of IoT in many commercial as well as Government sectors. However, the security concerns such as authentication and data privacy of these devices play a fundamental role in successful integration of these two technologies. Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) based algorithms give better security solutions in comparison to other Public Key Cryptography (PKC) algorithms due to small key sizes and efficient computations. In this paper, a secure ECC based mutual authentication protocol for secure communication of embedded devices and cloud servers using Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) cookies has been proposed. The proposed scheme achieves mutual authentication and provides essential security requirements. The security analysis of the proposed protocol proves that it is robust against multiple security attacks. The formal verification of the proposed protocol is performed using AVISPA tool, which confirms its security in the presence of a possible intruder.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things, an emerging global Internet-based technical architecture facilitating the exchange of goods and services in global supply chain networks has an impact on the security and privacy of the involved stakeholders. Measures ensuring the architecture's resilience to attacks, data authentication, access control and client privacy need to be established. An adequate legal framework must take the underlying technology into account and would best be established by an international legislator, which is supplemented by the private sector according to specific needs and thereby becomes easily adjustable. The contents of the respective legislation must encompass the right to information, provisions prohibiting or restricting the use of mechanisms of the Internet of Things, rules on IT-security-legislation, provisions supporting the use of mechanisms of the Internet of Things and the establishment of a task force doing research on the legal challenges of the IoT. ?? 2010 Prof Rolf H.

abstract = {Since the open architecture at the perception layer, the IoT not only faces the traditional security risks in TCP/IP network, but also faces the new emerging risks. In this paper, through analysising the infrastructure of IoT and the security risks in IoT, a new multi-layer security model is proposed, which aims to improve the security technique in IoT. Based on the new model, a series of effective ways to the security risks are discussed at each different layer, respectively. The characteristics of the model and the application domain are summarized to give out, too. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) is playing a more and more important role after its showing up, it covers from traditional equipment to general household objects such as WSNs and RFID. With the great potential of IoT, there come all kinds of challenges. This paper focuses on the security problems among all other challenges. As IoT is built on the basis of the Internet, security problems of the Internet will also show up in IoT. And as IoT contains three layers: perception layer, transportation layer and application layer, this paper will analyze the security problems of each layer separately and try to find new problems and solutions. This paper also analyzes the cross-layer heterogeneous integration issues and security issues in detail and discusses the security issues of IoT as a whole and tries to find solutions to them. In the end, this paper compares security issues between IoT and traditional network, and discusses opening security issues of IoT.},
