Latex project of report on <b>Next Generation Security for IoT in Post Quantum Era</b>

<b>Abstract</b>
Internet of Things (IoT) is developing rapidly. As more and more smart devices being connected into network, the
security problem has become the primary concern. In the past years, many cryptography based security solutions are
proposed in literature. But the building blocks of these solutions are threatened by the arrival of quantum computing era.
In this research, we study the cryptographic primitives that are suitable for the resource constrained IoT applications and
also strong enough to resist the destructive power of quantum computers. We identify that lattice based cryptography
and symmetric key cryptography are among the most simple and ecient algorithms among all the post quantum
cryptographic primitives. We then explore the authentication problem in RFID based IoT application and discuss the
stream cipher based authentication schemes.
